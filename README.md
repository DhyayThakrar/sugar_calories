  I am analyzing a dataset which contains information about various food recipes as well as their reviews gathered from [food.com](food.com)<br>
  By analyzing the dataset, I want to answer an extremely important question which most health freaks are looking an answer for: <strong>Does sugaras an ingredient in your recipe means the recipe will have higher calories? </strong><br>
